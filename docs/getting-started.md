To use Pushpin, you need the following things:

- A Raspberry Pi 5
- An Ableton Push 2
- A USB audio interface of some variety
- A way to burn disk images to SSD card

We're working on adding a sequencer to Pushpin, but currently it lacks any ability to sequence.
Until we release that feature, we recommend the following for sequencing notes:

- Any MIDI-based sequencer (Kinga's a fan of the Elektron Rytm mk II and uses that in demos)
- A USB midi interface

## 1. Download Pushpin image

Please see our [Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/KingaJanicka/pushpin-groovebox/releases)

## 2. Burn to SD card

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has a good tutorial for doing this here:

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2

During this process, you can also configure network settings, which you'll
need to do if you don't have a keyboard and mouse plugged into the Pi.

## 3. Plug everything in and hit power

Connect everything together; how you do this depends on what sequencer and soundcard you're using.

Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi 5 device and hit power; the Linux distribution will boot and
you will automatically be logged in as the user `pushpin` (default password: `groovebox`).

Power on the Ableton Push 2 device if you have not yet done so.

You should hopefully now be running Pushpin!

## 4. Configure MIDI devices

To sequence, you currently need to connect a MIDI sequencer. To select this:

1. Press the "Setup" button twice. This will bring you to the MIDI setup page.
2. Twist the first encoder to set your "in" device to your MIDI sequencer.

#Â Troubleshooting

This is very in-development software so usually the easiest way to resolve an issue is to update the latest version.
You can change the version of Pushpin by navigating to `/pushpin` and typing:

```
$ git fetch origin && git tag
```

To check out a different version, type:

```
$ git checkout <version>
```

Pushpin has a Wayland-based graphical user interface you can use if you're connected via a screen and keyboard.

To load it, type:

```
$ wayfire-pi
```

This includes a number of useful tools for hacking on, troubleshooting, and extending Pushpin. Chief amongst these is `qpwgraph`, which you can use to visually troubleshoot Pipewire connectivity.
